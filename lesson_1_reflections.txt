How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    using diff, it shows all the difference between two versions of file, so you can just look directly to the differences rather than screen all of the texts

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	
	it can helped me see what mistake or bug that I made so I won't do that again

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	
	pros: It's more flexible and we have to control what we want our history be
	cons: Sometimes if we manually do something, we will forget to do it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	because Git is version control systems for programming/software, and programmers used to use more than 1 file to make program, and those files are highly connected (HTML with CSS)
